## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---

A computer programming student at Algonquin College.

I mainly focus on Java, SQL, Front-end (HTML, CSS, JS, React) and some back-end (mostly PHP). I'm available to work on any project which use these languages.

Currently, I'm working on a website for event management. It uses JS on the front-end and a PHP and MySQL back-end.
